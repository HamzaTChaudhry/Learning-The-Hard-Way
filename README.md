# Python3-the-Hard-Way

I review essential Python3 syntax and knowledge using the textbook "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw to cement my 
pre-existing knowledge and develop master with key functions/packages. I've been programming in Python for years as a scientist, but I'd like to improve the readibility and efficiency of my code for collaborations in industry.

After I finish the first book and all of its corresponding exercises/projects, I will work on training higher level skills that
will be useful in data science and software engineering in large companies. I will move onto the textbook 
"Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw (pretty straight-forward progression). 

I will update this repository periodically as I find time.
